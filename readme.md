# Hapi Everything

A Hapi server with multiple frontends.

## Why?

To compare frontend libraries and frameworks.

## Aims

### Modular 

It's easy to create a Hapi server with basic routes, better still is to pull functionality into modules, both Hapi modules (route logic and orchestration) and business modules (CRUD and business rules for domain objects).

### Frontends

Create the same application in multiple libaries/frameworks to compare them.
